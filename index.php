                    The team at Maya Music has made me feel so welcome throughout enquiring about lessons to taking my first one. I wanted to learn a new skill and was a bit unsure about learning an instrument as an adult, however the team at Maya Music have been supportive throughout my entire experience, offering classes outside of regular times to suit my work schedule and just generally being helpful and encouraging. I'm just finishing up Term One and am excited to head back for another, my drum lessons are a highlight of my week and I feel like I'm covering not only the basics, but also the fun parts too! I have and will continue to recommend the amazing staff at Maya Music - they're great!

                    Biggest warm thanking from Grant & Debbie from Australia allowing us to jam with our rhythm guitarist Dave who moved back to NZ. It's was a very special moment after 4 long years being appart we finally hit the songs that made us feel great and jamed the back room. We really appricated the effort and the gear to play while visiting. We hope to return it was terrific big thnak you Therese and Deo for bringing big smiles and joy back into our lives
