            <h2>Martin Guy</h2>
            <h3>Drums</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="bio">
            <p>Martin originates from the Isles of Scilly where he started his musical career at age 9 singing in his first band ‘No Pulse’. When the original drummer had to leave the--> islands to attend college, Martin said “I’ll give the drums a go too!”.

                Realising he was much better suited to drumming than singing, No Pulse found a replacement singer and the rest is history… Fast forward to 2012, Martin received a Bachelor with honours degree in popular music, with a focus on music performance, after which he decided to travel to the world. In March of 2014, Martin found himself in Queenstown and fell in love with the town - and the music scene - quickly establishing himself as one of the town’s most sought after drummers. When not teaching at Maya, he can be seen playing all manner of gigs from the corner of the local bar, all the way to being on stage at the memorial hall in full musical productions, with a number of weddings and corporate gigs squeezed in between for good measure!</p>
